ERP Education Dashboard

This project provides an education-focused analytics dashboard for users across the academic ecosystem (teachers, students, content creators, institutions, and admins).
It works similar to a learning platform like YouTube, where users can upload videos, post comments, and reply — and the system tracks engagement and activity.

The dashboard helps visualize and understand how users interact, where they come from, and what content performs well.
